- 👋 hi, i’m haily merritt! i'm a phd student in complex networks and cognitive science @ indiana university.
- 👀 i do a lot of math to show why  our brains care about having good relationships. i combine tools from graph theory, dynamical systems theory, information theory, and computational topology, as well as theoretical frameworks from neuroecology, autopoiesis and enactivism, evolution and development, epistemology, and philosophy of sociality.

- 💞️ i’m looking to collaborate on anything connecting methods from complexity science (like network science and dynamical systems) to social neuroecology.
- 📫 how to reach me: halamerr@iu.edu
