- 👋 hi, i’m haily merritt! i'm a phd student in complex networks and cognitive science @ indiana university.
- 👀 i’m interested in network neuroecology. i study how tools from graph theory, dynamical systems theory, 
    and information theory can be applied to brain networks (both human and simulated) to learn about the 
    brain's role in adaptation to the environment.
- 💞️ i’m looking to collaborate on anything connecting methods from complexity science to neuroecology.
- 📫 how to reach me: halamerr@indiana.edu
