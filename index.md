Hi! I am a PhD student in [cognitive science](https://www.brainnetworkslab.com/people) and [complex networks](https://www.brainnetworkslab.com/people) at Indiana University, where I do research on network neuroecology. I use tools from complexity science (like graph theory, dynamical systems theory, and information theory) to learn about how our brains change to adapt to our environments. I'm really interested in how the social environment and perceived social support play a role in this process. I try to infuse perspectives from enactive and embodied cognitive science, process metaphysics, critical theory, and feminist epistemology where I can. I'm the grad student representative for [Women in Network Science](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/wins). When I'm not doing science, I love being in nature, reading, and making art. 


### Current projects

- How is variation in brain network features related to variation in perceived social support? How does the social environment influence neuroendophenotypes?
- How do evolved embodied simulated agents adapt to changes in their environments? What strategies are employed to acquire necessary nutrients in the face of change?
